# Data from Mexico at the Municipal level

I used this script to get climatic information from the municipal handbooks 
(Prontuarios Estad√≠sticos Municipales) by INEGI. They have quite a lot of 
interesting information about each of the 2,000+ municipalities in Mexico, and I 
thought that the script would be interesting to someone else.

You can use this scripts to get info on many other variables as well, ranging 
from topographic to geographic information. Please feel free to use distribute 
and manipulate this scripts to your convenience according to its license.
